# Fig_Fri_Week_47_2024 - UFO sightings
Plotly's weekly data visualization initiative 

There have been thousands of UFO sightings in north America since the 20th century. So this week Figure Friday explores a data set by the National UFO Reporting Center (Kaggle) on UFO sightings from 1998 to 2014.

Appreciate any comments or suggestions.
