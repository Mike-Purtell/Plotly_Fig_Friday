However, oil continued to usurp coal markets, so that the mine soon depended on production and transportation subsidies. The McBean closed on June 30, 1972.

Various mines were opened at Coal Creek, Natal, Michel and Morrissey. After the Second World War demand for coal dropped and the company diversified through a subsidiary, Crow's Nest Pass Oil and Gas Company. As the 1950s and 1960s progressed the mines were closed and the company moved into the forest products area.
