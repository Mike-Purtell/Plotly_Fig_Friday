# Fig_Fri_Week_46_2024 - Italian and Frence Wines
Plotly's weekly data visualization initiative 

Italy and France produce more than half of the wines that fall under the Protected Designation of Origin label within the European Union.

This week’s data set explores over 5000 wines from France and Italy. Parameters include the wine name, max allowed yields, category, color, registration date and more.

Here are a few minor improvements to this week's sample visualization, a violin chart. 

Red, White, and Rose wine categories are associated with color, so I used these colors for the data visualization. The color for white is from a deep chardonnay, for red I used a color named winered, and for rosé I extracted a color from a web picture.

For other touch-ups, I replaced FR, IT with France, Italy, removed Country= from  the label above each facet, took out the xlabel Color from below each facet, and used the 'plotly_dark' template for a good background.

Appreciate any comments or suggestions.
