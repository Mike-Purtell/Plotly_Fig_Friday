# Plotly_Fig_Friday
This repo contains my weekly submissions to Plotly's Figure Friday data visualization challenge. 
All weeks are stored in separate folders, placed under the appropriate year. So far, only 2024, but I have a feeling that a new folder is coming soon. The code for each week is directly
uploaded to the Plotly community page, however for convenience anyone can get the code here. The repo will be referenced in posts to discord, Bluesky and Linkedin as a convenience.
