# Plotly_Fig_Friday
This repo contains has my weekly submissions to Plotly's Figure Friday data visualization challenge. 
These are grouped by year, with 2024 as the only folder so far. The code for each week is directly
uploaded to the Plotly community page. The repo will be referenced in posts to discord, Bluesky and Linkedin.
